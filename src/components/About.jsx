      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
       I am a Technical Writer with a <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science</strong> and a focus on 
        building documentation systems that scale. Currently at <strong>ArmorCode</strong>, I specialize 
        in <strong>AI Content Engineering</strong>, leveraging <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong> and 
        LLMs to automate documentation workflows and enhance developer experience. From documenting complex 
        REST APIs with Swagger and Postman to crafting user-centric help centers, I bridge the gap between 
        deep technical architecture and intuitive user guidance, ensuring that high-impact products are 
        supported by high-performance documentation.
